This lexicon is an extention of WordNet-Affect (WNA) emotion lexicon [Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007], which is a subset of English WordNet. Each entry (synset) in this lexicon is annotated with one of six emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise), which are considered as the basic human
emotions according to the psychological study conducted in [Ekman, 1992]. 

we manually translated it into Arabic. The Table below describes the English and the Arabic lexicons, where |syn| is the number
of synsets (synonym words are grouped into sets and called synsets), and |w| is the number of words associated with each emotion label.
